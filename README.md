# AngularJS Web Client Application

This subproject generates web client assets using [`sbt-web`](https://github.com/sbt/sbt-web) plugins.

You will notice then when you compile your application, Javascript files are linted and LESS CSS files are compiled to CSS.

The only Scala code is for providing `spray-routing` routes to serve up the generated resources from a `spray-can` server that deploys this client application.

TODO(markschaake): provide more details / links for developing web application
